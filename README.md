# Computational Notebooks

## Introduction

The intention of these series of notebooks is to give a complete overview of the scientific computing methods available for solving mathematical problems. While there is currently only a notebook on solving differential equations, the goal is to develop more notebooks, with the hope of curating an entire series that will serve as a reference for many.
